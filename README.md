```
A collection of Azure functions which perform background processing in the Courses API.

Store individual json documents in a GitHub repository for the IFATE published standards to maintain a searchable history of changes to IFATE data over time. Using 
a GitHub repository allows history and change comparison to be made between dates.
```

## üöÄ Installation

### Pre-Requisites

```
* A clone of this repository
* A code editor that supports Azure functions and .NetCore 8.0
* A GitHub repository which is a fork of SkillsFundingAgency/StandardsData
```
### Config

```
This utility uses the standard Apprenticeship Service configuration. All configuration can be found in the [das-employer-config repository](https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/das-employer-config).

* GitHub repository name which is a fork of.
* GitHub username having contributor access to the repository.
* GitHub access token which is a fine-grained personal access token created by the above user with access to the above repository.
```

local.settings.json file
```json
{
    "IsEncrypted": false,
    "Values": {
      "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
      "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated",
      "ConfigNames": "SFA.DAS.Courses.Jobs",
      "EnvironmentName": "LOCAL",
      "ConfigurationStorageConnectionString": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
      "UpdateStandardsTimerSchedule": "0 0 1 1 *",
      "GitHubAccessToken": ""
  }
}
```
>`GitHubAccessToken` should be populated with a fine-grained personal access token created by the user with access to the GitHub repository. Go to https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens to generate a new token. The token should have full read-write access to a repository. 

#### Azure Table Storage config

Row Key: SFA.DAS.Courses.Jobs_1.0

Partition Key: LOCAL

Data:

```json
{
  "CoursesApiClientConfiguration": {
    "ApiBaseUrl": "",
    "IdentifierUri": "",
    "Version": ""
  },
  "InstituteOfApprenticeshipsApiConfiguration": {
    "ApiBaseUrl": "https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/api/",
    "StandardsPath": "apprenticeshipstandards",
    "FoundationApprenticeshipsPath": "foundationapprenticeships"
  },
  "FunctionsConfiguration": {
    "UpdateStandardsConfiguration": {
      "GitHubConfiguration": {
        "RepositoryName": "",
        "UserName": "",
        "Email": "",
        "AccessTokenConfiguration": {
          "KeyVaultIdentifier": "",
          "KeyVaultSecretName": "GitHubBearerToken"
        }
      },
      "Enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### GitHub Integration

The storage config needs to contain the RepositoryName in the format "Scope/RepositoryName", a UserName of an account which can access the respository and the associated Email for the account.

When running locally the local.settings.json file needs to contain a KeyVaultSecretName key which matches the value of the KeyVaultSecretName in the storage config.

When running locally add a fine-grained access token to the local.settings.json file which allows access to the RepositoryName with permissions of Contents (Read + Write)

When running in an environment add the fine-grained access token to the KeyVaultIdentifier secrets collection see https://skillsfundingagency.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NDL/pages/4894261340/Courses+Jobs+GitHub+Integration
